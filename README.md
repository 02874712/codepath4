## Overview
### Description
[Description of your app]

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Productivity**
- **Mobile:**
- **Story: Allows user to monitor events by day, week, or month. The events are displayed to the user, and the user can add tasks to a to do list.**
- **Market: This app is open for any individual to use.**
- **Habit: This app can be used daily to keep track of events and tasks.**
- **Scope: We would start with users creating events and tasks, and then eventually we could integrate API's to add location features that correspond with an event. Eventually events can be shared with others by email. This app has the potential to be interactive, productive, and multi-functional.**
